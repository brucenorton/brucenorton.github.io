  <h1> bruce </h1><h3>why can't I add a line all of a sudden?</h3>
  <p>This is so bizarre, arrow keys & return no longer work</p>
  <p>and now it's back.</p>
  <p>but commits don't seem to be instantaneous</p>
  <p><strong>I commit, check the page and it seems to be <del>the n-1 commit</del> just a time thing. Takes a couple minutes to update after committing.</p>
  <p>hmm</p>
  <p>okay, so the build pages & deployment takes 2-3 minutes.</p>
  <p>check "actions" tab to see updates.</p>
